# Final Submission

By the due date (15/04/2022 23:59), please have ready: 

- In your GitHub readme, post a link to a 5 minute **video** demonstrating the application (try to show all the main features of your application and explain them in the video using your scenarios and personas).   
- In your GitHub readme, please make sure you have updated the link to your deployed **final application** (if creating a new account is required, please provide us with a testing account credentials). Pay special attention to usability issues, look & feel, and simplicity.
- For your GitHub repository,make sure that all your **supplemental material** posted in your GitHub repository are in order and complete:
   - all **source code** is up to date 
   - **documentation** (product page, Wiki, project documentation, description of main use cases/personas/scenarios, architectural overview, main APIs/features, installation and usage instructions, the user study and user feedback, and any other relevant information).
-  a **reflection by each member** (at most one page) of how you on contributed to the project, what tasks you did, what you **learned** and the **challenges** you faced. Please submit these to us via Brightspace individually. 

After that date, the course staff will examine your projects, test them and evaluate them, without you being present, so it is very important that everything would be self explained.

Make sure to fix issues that we gave you feedback on during the last milestone, and in case you need further clarifications, message us on Slack. 

**Important note:** Full grading for the Final Submission (30 points) will be determined by the following criteria:

1. Interesting use case (is it useful? have you shown or convinced us that people already use or may use it?)
2. User experience (intuitive, self explanatory)
3. Functional complexity
4. Technical difficulty (uses various technologies and resources)
5. Finishing level (bugs, missing features)
6. Documentation (is it useful for users/developers) 

Good luck,  
Peggy and Alessandra
