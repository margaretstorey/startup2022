# Final Submission

(instructions in progress...)

By the due date (15/04/2022 23:59), please have ready: 

- In your GitHub readme, post a link to a 5 minute **video** demonstrating the application.
   - Try to show all the main features of your application and explain them in the video using your scenarios and personas.
   - Create a cover page in your video to show the course info, all team members, project name, tagline, and link to your GitHub and/or product page.   
- In your GitHub readme, please make sure you have updated the link to your deployed **final application**.
   - If creating a new account is required, please provide us with a testing account credentials. 
   - Pay special attention to usability issues, look & feel, and simplicity.
- For your GitHub repository, make sure that all your **supplemental material** posted are in order and complete:
   - All **source code** is up to date.
   - All **documentation** is up to date including your product page, Wiki, project documentation, description of main use cases/personas/scenarios, architectural overview, main APIs/features, installation and usage instructions, the user study and user feedback, and any other relevant information.
-  Please write a max. one page **reflection by each member** of how you contributed to the project, specifying which tasks you did, what you **learned** and the **challenges** you faced. Please submit these to us via Brightspace individually (we will set up an assignment for this). 

After the due date, the course staff will examine your projects, test them and evaluate them, without you being present, so it is very important that everything is self explained.

Make sure to fix any issues that we gave you feedback about during the last milestone (we will send these to you by April 8th).  If you need further clarifications, message us on Slack. 

**Important note:** Full grading for the Final Submission (30 points) will be determined by the following criteria:

1. Interesting use cases for the application that show the business value proposition you submitted earlier. _(6 points)_
2. User experience (intuitive, self explanatory). _(3 points)_
3. Technical difficulty (uses various technologies and resources). _(3 points)_
4. Documentation (see the list above). _(6 points)_
5. Video showing the main features (clarity, creativity, appropriate use of the time and resources). _(6 points)_
6. Individual reflections. _(6 points)_

Good luck,  
Peggy and Alessandra
