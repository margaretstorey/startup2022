# Milestone 2 - Release Candidate

For the second milestone (due on Friday, 11/03/2022) you are required to show progress based on the feedback you've received from the mentors about Milestone 1.


### Presentation

Prepare a **10-minute presentation**:
- [4-5 minutes] Please provide a full demonstration of using your product in various scenarios.
  - The demonstration should encompass your top features, and highlight new features or changes made since Milestone 1.
  - If a live demo is impossible, show a demo video (this may be the case if you recently pivoted).
  - Make sure you have a backup for the demo (either video or screenshots).
- [2-3 minutes] You should present how you have gathered user (customer) feedback as you developed this (and the previous) milestones and what you learned.
- [2-3 minutes] Continue with a short presentation of:
  - [1-1.5 minutes] Your feature list (what is done? which features are expected?) and your road map (what to expect in the future milestones?)
  - [1-1.5 minutes] Your progress and group reflection on what you have learned (which are the main challenges? why?)

The project's presentation order will be decided on the presentation day (the same approach used for Milestone 1 presentations).

After your presentation, we will open for a 12-15 minutes Q&A session. 

You should also be prepared to talk about your development process, in case you are asked: what is your plan for the next Milestone? how long do you expect the work would take? how did you split the work? what was easy? what was difficult? what risks lay ahead? Have some prepared slides on these points that we can refer to but you do not need to present them.

Please send us a copy of your presentation/slides (or link) via message on your group Slack channel until 1 pm on March 11.


### Project Hosting (GitHub)

You are required to continue working on your GitHub repository and product page.
- **Provide a link to your live application.**
- Keep the project documentation updated (e.g., list of issues/features, wiki, technical details for the implementation; team contributions; license;).
- Present a clear product page considering a potential final user (e.g., include screenshots of how they will be using your application).
- Please read [this document carefully](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qozhqNO6fsd3kkaVSbxfcLA1QUXH4BmD_FBxo_ZxMMU/edit?usp=sharing) (additional details on project documentation and the teaching team expectations).


### Some general advice

- Don't wait until the milestone meeting to get feedback, ask for advice and feedback throughout the weeks before.
- Prepare an appealing demo! Remind us of your tagline as you start to present.
- You have only a short time for the demonstration so focus on the new features or changes you've made since Milestone 1. Use your personas during your demo to remind us of the value of your application.
- If you are demonstrating social features of your application, or any other features that require prior preparations - please prepare them in advance! (e.g. creating social networks of several users). 
- It is also advised to rehearse your presentation so it will flow nicely. For example: make sure you can demonstrate different users simultaneously using different browsers.


### Grading

**Important note:** Full grading for Milestone 2 (25 points) will be given for teams that successfully:

1. Focus on the primary use case and take into account our feedback from milestone 1 or earlier.
2. Follow the project plan while adapting dynamically.
3. Continuously work throughout the semester.
4. Have sought feedback from potential customers or users and applied that learning.
5. Demonstrate an interesting, self contained, useful and live application.
6. Providing a link to the live application.
7. Give a good presentation (simple, clear, focused, time-framed, sincere)

A further breakdown of how the final score will be computed:
- Project Hosting / GitHub = 4 points
  - 2 for Project Hosting & Organization
  - 2 for Product Page
- Presentation = 21 points
  - 10 for Demonstration
  - 4 for Feedback users / customers
  - 4 for Presentation (Style, timing, engagement, etc.)
  - 1 for Features and Roadmap
  - 1 for Group Reflection
  - 1 for Q&A
  

If you have any questions or comments please do not wait for the milestone meeting, please contact the course instructors via Slack.

Good luck!
